%h4 The Imiq Hydroclimate Database
%p
  The Imiq Hydroclimate database houses hydrologic, climatologic, and soils
  data collected in Alaska and Western Canada from the early 1900s to the present.
  This database unifies and preserves numerous data collections that have, 
  until now, been stored in field notebooks, on desktop computers, as well as
  in disparate databases.  Synthesizing and analyzing the large-scale hydroclimate
  characteristics of this important climatic region have been made easier with this
  searchable database. Data is made accessible via the Imiq API.

%h4 Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control
%p
  Data have not been subjected to QA/QC after receipt from the source, except for broad, variable-specific thresholds. Data may have been altered from their original form as part of normalization into the database and any data flagged by their source as questionable were omitted. Please examine the documentation automatically downloaded with the data and use data at your own risk.

%h4 How to Cite the Data
%p
  Please cite both the data originator and the Imiq Data Portal.  In many cases,
  data may be changed from their original units or averaged across time periods.
  The metadata pertaining to the originator will be downloaded with the data.  The

%h4 Project Partners
%p
  Construction of the Imiq Hydroclimate Database and the Imiq Data Portal 
  was funded by the Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (LCC) and 
  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Development of the Imiq Data Portal 
  was funded by the Arctic LCC and the North Slope Science Initiative and 
  implemented by the Geographic Information Network of Alaska (GINA). Data 
  were contributed from many agencies and investigator-driven research 
  projects.
